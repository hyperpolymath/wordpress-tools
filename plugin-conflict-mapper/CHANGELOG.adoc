- Some hook conflicts are unavoidable (WordPress core hooks)
- Security scanning uses pattern matching (may have false positives/negatives)
- Overlap detection relies on plugin names and descriptions
- WP-CLI requires WP-CLI to be installed
- REST API requires authentication

=== Future Enhancements

See README.md roadmap section for planned features.
