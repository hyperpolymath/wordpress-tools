  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get scan results
curl https://yoursite.com/wp-json/wpcm/v1/scan/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get all plugins
curl https://yoursite.com/wp-json/wpcm/v1/plugins \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
----

=== Understanding Scan Results

==== Conflict Types

*Hook Conflicts*::
Multiple plugins hooking into the same WordPress action or filter. Can cause unexpected behavior or performance issues. Severity depends on the hook and number of plugins using it.

*Function Conflicts*::
Two or more plugins defining functions with the same name. Will cause fatal PHP errors if both plugins are active. Always high severity.

*Global Variable Conflicts*::
Plugins using the same global variable names. Can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior. Medium severity in most cases.

*Database Table Conflicts*::
Multiple plugins creating or accessing the same database tables. High risk of data corruption. Always high severity.

==== Overlap Categories

The plugin categorizes overlaps into common functionality areas:

* SEO
* Caching
* Security
* Backup
* Forms
* E-commerce
* Social Media
* Analytics
* Media Management
* Email/Newsletter
* Page Builders
* Spam Protection

=== Plugin Rankings

Plugins are scored 0-100 based on:

* *Conflicts* (max -40 points): Penalties for involvement in conflicts
* *Overlaps* (max -30 points): Penalties for functional redundancy
* *Complexity* (max -20 points): Code complexity and size
* *Size* (max -10 points): File size impact
* *Maintenance*: Version information availability

.Score Interpretation
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Score Range |Interpretation

|80+
|Excellent - Well-behaved, minimal issues

|60-79
|Good - Minor issues to monitor

|40-59
|Fair - Several issues, review recommended

|<40
|Poor - Significant problems, consider alternatives
|===

=== Security Analysis

The security scanner checks for:

. *Dangerous Functions*: eval(), exec(), system(), shell_exec(), etc.
. *SQL Injection Risks*: Direct database queries without preparation
. *XSS Vulnerabilities*: Unescaped user input
. *File Operation Risks*: Insecure file handling

.Risk Levels
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Level |Description

|Safe
|No issues detected

|Low
|Minor concerns, generally acceptable

|Medium
|Some issues present, monitoring recommended

|High
|Significant vulnerabilities found

|Critical
|Severe security problems, immediate action required
|===

=== Settings

Configure the plugin behavior:

*Automatic Scanning*::
* Enable/disable scheduled scans
* Set frequency: daily, weekly, or monthly

*Data Retention*::
* Specify how long to keep scan results
* Default: 30 days

*Alert Threshold*::
* Choose minimum severity for notifications
* Options: low, medium, high, critical

*Email Reports*::
* Enable/disable email notifications
* Configure notification email address

=== Export & Reporting

Export scan results in multiple formats:

*JSON Export*::
* Complete scan data with all details
* Ideal for programmatic processing
* Includes metadata and timestamps

*CSV Export*::
* Conflict summary in spreadsheet format
* Easy to share with non-technical stakeholders
* Includes conflict type, severity, and affected plugins

== Best Practices

=== Conflict Resolution

. *Identify High-Severity Conflicts First*
+
--
* Focus on function and table conflicts
* These can cause immediate site breakage
--

. *Review Functional Overlaps*
+
--
* Keep only one plugin per function
* Example: Use only one SEO plugin, one caching plugin
--

. *Monitor Hook Conflicts*
+
--
* Some hook conflicts are acceptable
* Watch for conflicts on critical hooks (init, wp_head, etc.)
--

. *Test Changes*
+
--
* Always test in a staging environment first
* Deactivate one plugin at a time
* Verify functionality after each change
--

=== Performance Optimization

. *Reduce Plugin Count*
+
--
* Each plugin adds overhead
* Consolidate functionality where possible
--

. *Choose Lightweight Alternatives*
+
--
* Use the rankings to identify heavy plugins
* Look for alternatives with better scores
--

. *Regular Scans*
+
--
* Run scans after plugin updates
* Schedule periodic scans (weekly recommended)
--

. *Clean Up Unused Plugins*
+
--
* Delete inactive plugins
* Remove plugins that are no longer needed
--

=== Extending the Plugin

==== Hooks & Filters

[source,php]
----
// Modify scan results before saving
add_filter('wpcm_scan_results', function($results) {
    // Your custom logic
    return $results;
});

// Add custom conflict detector
add_action('wpcm_detect_conflicts', function($plugins) {
    // Your custom detection logic
});

// Modify plugin ranking
add_filter('wpcm_plugin_score', function($score, $plugin_file) {
    // Adjust score based on custom criteria
    return $score;
}, 10, 2);
----

==== REST API Endpoints

*Base URL*: `/wp-json/wpcm/v1/`

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Endpoint |Method |Description

|`/plugins`
|GET
|Get all installed plugins

|`/scan`
|POST
|Run a new conflict scan

|`/scan/{id}`
|GET
|Get specific scan results

|`/scans`
|GET
|Get recent scans

|`/stats`
|GET
|Get scanning statistics
|===

NOTE: All endpoints require `manage_options` capability.

==== Database Schema

.*wpcm_scans*
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE wp_wpcm_scans (
    id bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    scan_date datetime NOT NULL,
    plugin_count int(11) NOT NULL,
    conflict_count int(11) NOT NULL,
    overlap_count int(11) NOT NULL,
    scan_data longtext,
    scan_type varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
----

.*wpcm_conflicts*
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE wp_wpcm_conflicts (
    id bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    scan_id bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    conflict_type varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    severity varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    affected_plugins text,
    conflict_data longtext,
    created_at datetime NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
----

=== Code Examples

==== Custom Scan Handler

[source,php]
----
add_action('wpcm_loaded', function() {
    $scanner = wpcm()->scanner;
    $detector = wpcm()->detector;

    $plugins = $scanner->get_active_plugins();
    $conflicts = $detector->detect_conflicts($plugins);

    // Process results
    foreach ($conflicts as $type => $conflict_list) {
        // Handle each conflict type
    }
});
----

==== Cache Integration

[source,php]
----
$cache = new WPCM_Cache();

// Store data
$cache->set('my_key', $data, 3600);

// Retrieve data
$data = $cache->get('my_key');

// Remember pattern (get or generate)
$data = $cache->remember('my_key', function() {
    return expensive_operation();
}, 3600);
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

*Scan Takes Too Long*::
* Large number of plugins (50+) can slow scans
* Increase PHP max_execution_time
* Run scans via WP-CLI for better performance

*Memory Errors*::
* Increase PHP memory_limit (recommended: 256M+)
* Reduce number of active plugins
* Use command-line scanning for large installations

*Database Errors*::
* Ensure database user has CREATE TABLE permissions
* Check database server connection
* Verify table prefix matches WordPress config

*Permission Errors*::
* Plugin requires `manage_options` capability
* Only administrators can run scans
* Check user roles and capabilities

== Performance Considerations

* Scans can be resource-intensive on large sites
* Use caching to improve subsequent scan performance
* Schedule scans during low-traffic periods
* Consider WP-CLI for large installations
* Limit scan history retention for better database performance

== Security

* All AJAX requests use nonce verification
* Capability checks on all admin operations
* SQL queries use prepared statements
* User input is properly sanitized and escaped
* REST API endpoints require authentication
