# Build script for semantic_processor WASM module

# This script builds the Rust code to WASM using wasm-pack.
# Note: Due to network restrictions, wasm-pack must be installed via cargo:
#   cargo install wasm-pack
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh [--dev]
#
# Options:
#   --dev    Build in development mode (faster, larger)
#   (default is release mode)
