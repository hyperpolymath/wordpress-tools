# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning
* Respecting people's time and contributions
* Providing attribution and credit where due

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
  setting
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-focused requests
* Sustained disruption of discussions or work
* Pattern of boundary violations after requests to stop

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* GitHub/GitLab repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Community chat channels (Discord, Matrix, Slack, etc.)
* Mailing lists and forums
* Social media interactions
* Conference talks and community events
* Any other community-related interaction

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@sinople.org**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. We will not share:

* Reporter's identity (unless permission is explicitly given)
* Details of the report outside the enforcement team
* Information that could identify the reporter

### Reporter Protection

Reporters will not face retaliation for good-faith reports. This includes:

* No public naming or shaming
* No reduction in project privileges
* No exclusion from community spaces
* Protection from counter-accusations

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Emotional Safety

Beyond preventing harassment, we actively promote **emotional safety** for all
contributors:

### Reversibility

We recognize that mistakes happen and people change. Our enforcement approach emphasizes:

* **Education over punishment** for first-time violations
* **Restoration over exclusion** when possible
* **Growth mindset** - people can learn and improve
* **Forgiveness** - past mistakes don't define someone forever

### Anxiety Reduction

We aim to reduce contributor anxiety through:

* **Clear expectations** - this Code of Conduct and CONTRIBUTING.md
* **Predictable processes** - documented enforcement guidelines
* **Safe experimentation** - TPCF Perimeter 3 allows risk-free contribution
* **Supportive feedback** - constructive, not destructive criticism
* **Right to disconnect** - no pressure for instant responses

### Mental Health Support

We acknowledge that open source can be stressful. We support:

* **Taking breaks** - no expectation of constant availability
* **Saying no** - declining requests is acceptable
* **Asking for help** - no question is too basic
* **Delegating work** - sharing load prevents burnout
* **Stepping back** - temporary or permanent disengagement is okay

## Political Neutrality

In line with the **Palimpsest License** philosophy, we maintain political neutrality:

* **No political litmus tests** for contribution
* **All jurisdictions welcome** - developers from any country
* **No geopolitical discrimination** - code quality matters, not politics
* **Safe haven** - protection from political persecution
* **Focus on code** - technical merit over political alignment

This doesn't mean we're apolitical about human rights - we oppose harassment and
discrimination. But we don't impose political conditions on code contributions.
