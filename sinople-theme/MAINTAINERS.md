# Maintainers and Contributors

This file lists all people who have contributed to the Sinople WordPress Theme, organized by the **Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)**.

## Governance Model

Sinople uses a **meritocratic governance** model:

1. **Perimeter 1** (Core Maintainers) - Strategic decisions, releases
2. **Perimeter 2** (Verified Contributors) - Review, merge, triage
3. **Perimeter 3** (Community) - Anyone can contribute

See [TPCF.md](TPCF.md) for full details.
